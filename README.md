Case 1: Forecasting Univariate Time Series with SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing - Citibike New York

This project is a part of the course EBC4008 Time Series Econometrics. Collaborators: Benedetta Schianchi, Bao Ngoc Phung Dang, Malika Jakobs-Neumeier, Lorenz Kowalczik, Viola Sada. 

In this case, we explore two of the most popular traditional time series methods, (S)ARIMA and ETS, for forecasting purposes on data for bicycle trips from Citi Bike in New York City. We use data from January to April 2023 as training sample to estimate several time series models. These models will then be used to evaluate their out-of-sample forecast performance on data from May 2023 (which is the test sample) using a rolling or expanding window approach.

Data is from Citi Bike in New York City. Citi Bike is owned by Lyft, an American leading mobility service provider, and operates in New York City since 2013. It is one of the largest bikeshare programs in the US, with over 25000 bikes and more than 1000 stations across New York City. The bicycling data for the city of New York is available on https://citibikenyc.com/system-data.
